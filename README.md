Build an analytics service to track events on websites.

Use Case

There are plenty of good analytic services, but that doesn't mean you can't build a better one. Your analytics service will offer a few key features:

A client-side JavaScript snippet that allows a user to track events on their website.
A server-side API that captures and saves those events to a database.
A Rails application that displays the captured event data for a user.
